# Day 2: Openings

**Reading**
*Writing Science* by Joshua Schimel

# Before workshop

# 1. Reach Chapter 5 of *Style* (online version)

Additional reading:

- Chapter 10 --- *Writing Science in Plain English*

# 2. Identify thematic strings in a paragraph from an example paper

> “Even if you use Twitter only for professional purposes, consider opening up a little bit to show your followers you are a real person. People outside your field are not likely to follow you if your tweets are only about sharing events, articles, and positions in your own field. You need to add an extra ingredient—your opinions, or something personal—to what you share. One way to do this is through sharing failures: a rejected paper or job application, or even a spilt coffee. This is a great way to give and receive moral support from other academics.”

I find this paragraph hard to read.

Characters I remember:

- real person

- followers

- your failures

- opinions

Conceptual center:

- persona

- likable

- relatable

These thematic strings that I recalled are indeed similar.
