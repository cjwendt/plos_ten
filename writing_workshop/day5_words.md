# Day 4: Words

# Before Workshop

# 1a. Read Chapter 7 from *Style* (same chapter in the second edition) 

# 1b. Read Chapter 6 from *Writing Science in Plain English*

**Additional Reading**

- Chapter 16 from Writing Science

# 2. Diagnose and fix word redundance in paragraphs from example papers

> “The \identify{question} of \identify{disease etiology} is complex. It is likely that a multitude of \identify{causes} is involved in the development of any particular disease. Where in the \identify{causal} chain, among the \identify{myriad of variables}, one chooses to examine and ascertain \identify{causation} is often a \identify{question} of where intervention is most efficacious. That, in turn, is often a political and not a scientific issue. An examination of the \identify{full range of variables} potentially involved in \identify{disease etiology}, with a synthesis of findings from all levels of analysis, provides the best opportunity for a full understanding of \identify{disease etiology}.”

> \note{We can attribute the development of disease to numerous variables and the complex ways in which they interact. Prevention and intervention efforts are most effective when these variables are clearly identified, teased apart, and well understood. This tends to be a political issue, removed from science. Researchers and policymakers must examine all factors that contribute to disease etiology and synthesize findings from all levels of analysis to gain holistic insight.}


> “But \identify{even} more importantly, Twitter culture has exposed \identify{a part} of academia that has \identify{traditionally always} been hidden from view, namely the inception of new research activities. Now, ECRs can observe and \identify{even} join the \identify{process} of creating national or international research projects (for instance, [6] stems from a discussion at Twitter and Bik et al [1] write their work resulted from online interactions). Senior researchers openly share ideas through Twitter and \identify{this can lead to the development of} new concepts which \identify{often move on} to become fully-fledged research projects.”

> \note{More importantly, Twitter culture has exposed the inception of new research activities---an often overshadowed, yet central aspect of academia. Now, ECRs observe and participate in national or international research projects. For instance, [6] originated from a discussion on Twitter and the work of Bik et al [1] resulted from online interactions. Senior researchers openly share ideas through Twitter, giving rise to innovation that sparks collaborative research projects.}

# 4a. Read Chapter 15 from Writing Science

# 4b. Read Chapter 5 from Writing Science in Plain English

# 5. Identify technical terms versus jargon in a paragraph from an example paper.

> “Natural \identify{hazard losses} \note{exhibit} an upward trend over time (Fig. 2). This is a \note{function} of increases in wealth and population (Cutter and Emrich 2005; Pielke et al. 2008) but is also attributed to better \identify{loss accounting} in recent years. The \note{escalating} pattern of \identify{hazard losses} is therefore partially an \note{artifact} of advances in \identify{reporting losses}, but how much or how little this effect contributes to the \note{skyrocketing losses} in comparison to effects of population growth and increasing wealth in \identify{high hazard} areas is unclear.”

Technical terms:

- hazard losses: losses suffered from natural hazards

- loss accounting:  in financial accounting, a loss is a decrease in net income that is outside the normal operations of the business

- high hazard: a hazard (any source of potential damage, harm or adverse health effects on something or someone) associated with high risk

Jargon:

- exhibit

- artifact

- skyrocketing

- function

- escalating

> \note{Natural hazard losses trend upward over time (Fig. 2) due to increases in wealth and population (Cutter and Emrich 2005; Pielke et al. 2008) and recently improved loss accounting. 
The continual escalation in hazard losses is thus, in part, a result of advances in reporting losses. However, we do not know the extent to which this effect contributes to the rise in losses compared the effect of population growth and wealth expansion in high hazard areas.}

# 6. Identify technical terms necessary in your manuscript.

- CRAN (The Comprehensive R Archive Network): large and traditional repository for R packages 

- Bioconductor: traditional repository for R packages related to bioinformatics and computational biology

- GitHub: public version control system; popular multi-purpose development platform also used for distribution

- developer: computer programmer that develops software such as R packages

- R packages: extend the functionality of base R (tools)

- rOpenSci: a non-profit organization committed to promoting open science practices through technical and social infrastructure for the R community; an ecosystem of open-source tools with peer reviewed R packages

- open source: software for which the original source code is made freely available and may be redistributed and modified

- documentation: various types of instruction and informational 'manuals' about a package

- vignette: a long-form type of documentation with examples, code, problems, solutions, and explanations

- S3 or S4 objects: two main approaches developers use to implement object-oriented programming in R

- specific packages and function calls (`tidyverse`, etc.)

- computational reproducibility: implementing transparent systems within the open science framework such as sharing code used in analyses so others can recreate results using stated methods
