# Day 2: Openings

**Reading**
*Writing Science* by Joshua Schimel

# Before workshop

# 1. Summarize your manuscript

The PLOS *Ten Simple Rules* series is a collection of approachable and concise articles that address some of the soft skills in science. My manuscript outlines ten simple rules for finding and selecting R packages. R and, by extension, R packages, are widely used in academia and other research settings. R users of all levels struggle to (1) find a package to accomplish a particular task or solve a problem of interest and (2) choose the best package to perform that task. Thus, we introduce R, describe the importance and availability of R packages, and propose ten simple rules for finding relevant packages and determining which package is best for one's desired use. These rules increase R's acessibility to a diverse audience and promote computational reproducibility in science.

# 2. Read Chapter 4 of *Writing Science*

# 3. Identify key Introduction components in an example paper

**Ten simple rules for Twitter**

What is the larger problem that the paper will be tackling?

- How can researchers and scientists use Twitter to collaborate and advance their careers?

What is the relevant context for that problem?

- increased use of social media platforms in academia

What are the key characters?

- researchers and scientists

What background information is given to help the reader understand 
the specific work in the paper?

- background info about Twitter and its uses

What is the "challenge" ("the specific hypotheses/questions/goals of
the current work")?

- Twitter can be used strategically by scientists to advance their careers


**Ecological fallacy**

What is the larger problem that the paper will be tackling?

- ramifications of the ecological fallacy as applied to epidemiology

What is the relevant context for that problem?

- ecological studies evaluated in epidemiological contexts

What are the key characters?

- ecological fallacy

- coefficient correlations

- epidemiologists

What background information is given to help the reader understand 
the specific work in the paper?

- established consequences of the ecological fallacy

What is the "challenge" ("the specific hypotheses/questions/goals of
the current work")?

- demonstrating three flawed notions that come from typical uses of the ecological fallacy

# 4. Read Chapter 5 of *Writing Science*

# 5. Diagnose the Opening for an example paper.

**Ecological fallacy**

Who do you think is the intended audience for the paper? 

- epidemiologists

- ecologists
 
What is the larger issue the paper will address? 

- ramifications of the ecological fallacy in epidemiological contexts

- an alternative approach to inference for understanding disease etiology

Do you think that they are properly "advertising" what they will later cover in the paper?

- high level overview

- three main points

# 6. Define Opening components for your paper

What is the target audience? Is it broad / interdisciplinary or targeted to
researchers in a certain field?

- researchers in computational biology and bioinformatics (PLOS Computational Biology Journal)

- R users more broadly (e.g., academia, healthcare, government, industry, students, etc.)

What is the larger issue that the manuscript will address?

- provide an accessible, yet thorough, overview of the purpose of R packages

- simplify the process of finding and selecting R packages in a transferable way

What are a few elements of the issue that are interesting but that your
manuscript will **not** address?

- R packages for specific tasks

- coding details

- technicalities of package development

# 7. Revise the Opening for your manuscript

see manuscript

# After workshop 

see manuscript for revisions and example articles

# 8. Read Chapters 6 and 7 of *Writing Science*

# 9. Evaluate the Funnel and Challenge of example papers

# 10. Define the Challenge of your manuscript

# 11. Read Chapters 8 and 9 of *Writing Science*
