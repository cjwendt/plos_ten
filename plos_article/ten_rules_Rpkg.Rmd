# Introduction

*Explain what R is and how its package ecosystem works.*

Points: 

- Open source project, where many people contribute with their own extensions
- Large variation in the quality of different extensions (packages)
- That some R users, particularly new ones, struggle with finding and picking which 
packages to use.

*Ideas of 10 things*

Finding packages: 

- CRAN task views
- Textbooks ("[x] with R"). May not be latest...
- Google searches, social media (#rstats)
- Conferences (and online streams of those). RStudio, UseR.

Picking a good package:

- On a public repository like CRAN or Bioconductor. Explain more about these repositories
and what their standards are. Explain their role in the community. Give the alternative
ways that R packages can be shared (GitHub, zipped file posted somewhere else). How
these regularly check code and help with managing the web of dependencies.
- Quality of the documentation. Types of documentation (help files, vignette, 
packagedown website, bookdown book).
- Coverage by tests. Explain about unit testing and how it can help control quality.
- Peer review. ROpenSci. Associated with a peer reviewed paper. Associated with a book
put out by a scientific publisher?
- Looking up package authors. Is there role in R development (RStudio, some big bio labs)?
Is the work part of their work from an academic lab? Do they have a history of a lot
of R development? GitHub profile. Google scholar profile. Also, is it a team of developers?
Robust team?
- Evidence of established package. Lots of version. Clear NEWS providing explanations of
changes. History of Issues and those being resolved.
- Exploring the code yourself. How open source framework provides this. GitHub mirror of
CRAN if you don't want to download the zipped package file yourself.
