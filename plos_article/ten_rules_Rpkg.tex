\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}}

R is a language and environment for statistical computing and graphics
that was developed by statisticians and is collaboratively maintained by
an international core group of contributors {[}2{]}. Unlike several
popular proprietary languages (e.g., MATLAB, SAS, SPSS), R is highly
extensible, free and open-source software; the user can access and thus
change, extend, and share code for desired applications. Accordingly, a
vibrant community of R users has emerged, many of which engage in the
development of extensions to the functionality of base R software known
as packages. There are plenty of analogies in computing that draw
comparisons between programming and culinary arts: recipe structures,
coding cookbooks, and the like. To conceptualize packages, imagine you
are the chef, R is the kitchen, and packages are the special gadgets
which allow you to cook and bake new recipes. R packages are coding
delectables that enable the user to perform practical tasks and solve
problems with interesting techniques.

Are there R packages for wrangling and cleaning data frames, designing
interactive apps for data visualization, or performing dimensionality
reduction? Yes! How do you find an R package that will help you train
regression and classification models, assess the beta diversity of a
population, or analyze gene expression microarray data? The answer is
not as simple; there are tens of thousands of R packages. As a natural
consequence of the open-source nature of R, there is variation in the
quality of different packages among the numerous choices that exist. The
advanced R user---having developed an intuition for their workflow---may
tend to be relatively confident when searching for and selecting
packages. By contrast, a common experience that characterizes learning R
at the outset is the struggle to 1) find a package to accomplish a
particular task or solve a problem of interest and 2) choose the best
package to perform that task. Even so, there remain obscure and
complicated problems that morph selecting an R package into a barrier
despite experience.

In coding as in life, we endeavor to make choices that optimize
outcomes. Just as one may go about shopping for shoes, deciding which
graduate program to pursue, or conducting a literature review, there is
a science behind selection. We inform our decisions by assessing,
comparing, and filtering options based on indicators of quality such as
utility, association, and reputation. Likewise, choosing an R package
requires attending to similar details. We outline ten simple rules for
finding and selecting R packages so that you will spend less time
searching for the right tools and more time coding delicious recipes.

\hypertarget{rule-1-consider-your-purpose}{%
\section{Rule 1: Consider your
purpose}\label{rule-1-consider-your-purpose}}

There are often several different ways to accomplish a task or arrive at
a solution while programming, albeit some ways are more elegant and
efficient than others. To optimize your workflow, consider your purpose
by 1) identifying your task to understand what you are trying to do and
2) defining the scope of the task to determine how you are going to do
it. For some tasks, coding your own recipe with existing tools is
practical, while other tasks benefit from new tools.

If the scope of your task is simple or reasonable given your knowledge
and skills, using an R package may not be appropriate. That is, some
instances do not warrant additional functions, datasets, documentation,
or other objects. There are advantages of coding in base R to implement
a unique solution for your problem. In particular, when you code from
scratch, you know precisely what you are running; thus, your script may
be easier to decipher and maintain. Conversely, packages require
reliance on shared code with features of which you may not be aware.

Packages are valuable when a task has a broad scope or is beyond the
scope of what you desire to code in base R; a task that is narrow in
scope is not necessarily simple. While there are ways to cook up an
algorithm using for loops and conditionals in base R, a relevant package
may accomplish the same goal in a more reproducible manner with less
code and fewer bugs. In general, the more reasonable it is for a given
task to be abstracted away from its context, the more plausible it is
that someone has generalized its themes, developed efficient algorithms,
and organized them in an intuitive way to share with other R users.
Extensive tasks justify sophisticated frameworks with several functions
that form a cohesive package. Numerous processes that involve
data---although varying in application---are ubiquitous. Data
manipulation is one such common task that has been streamlined by
packages such as \texttt{dplyr} and \texttt{tidyr} {[}3,4{]} (See Table
1). Nevertheless, there are indeed packages for seemingly singular
tasks, which you may favor over coding from scratch. Some R packages are
small and have a specific use conducive to tasks that require highly
specialized functions. For example, there is a package for converting
English letters to numbers as on a telephone keypad {[}5{]}.

If you define your purpose by making observations about and considering
limitations of your current toolbox before you start searching for new
tools, you will be more likely to recognize what you do (and do not)
need. Which existing functionalities in base R could be improved in
context of your problem? Which new functionalities would you like to add
to base R to expand what you can do? Develop a list of domain-specific
keywords that relate what you are trying to do, to how one may go about
doing it, to narrow your search. Identify the type of inputs you have
and envision working with them; contemplate the desired outputs and
corresponding format. For instance, suppose you are using Bioconductor
packages in analyses and have data you would like to visualize; you must
consider that the inputs will be of a certain class---namely, S4
objects---which impose restrictions when creating graphics. The data
visualization package you use should address such limitations.

\hypertarget{rule-2-spend-time-searching-find-and-collect-options}{%
\section{Rule 2: Spend time searching; find and collect
options}\label{rule-2-spend-time-searching-find-and-collect-options}}

Those who have used R packages may know that although leveraging
existing tools can be advantageous, the initial challenge of finding a
suitable package for a given task can obstruct potential benefits.
Relatedly, new R users who are unfamiliar with the structure and syntax
of the language may be hindered by the process of finding packages
because they do not know where to search, what to look for, nor how to
sift through options. R packages are mentioned in a variety of places
online, in print, and elsewhere. You can discover new packages anytime
you learn R-related topics, collaborate with other R users, or browse
the internet.

\textbf{Learn}

Packages are essential to venturing beyond base R and thus quickly
become an integral aspect of advancing your R skills. When learning how
to program in R, you are typically introduced to some of the most common
packages, which tend to have more general purposes (\textbf{Table 1}).
In addition, reputable online tutorials, courses, and books are helpful
resources for acquiring knowledge about packages that are versatile and
reliable---many of which are short, accessible, and either affordable or
offered at no cost to the learner. We recommend online R programming
courses such as those through
\href{https://www.coursera.org/learn/r-programming}{Coursera} and
\href{https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-r}{Codeacademy} for
interactive learning and R book series including the
\href{https://rstudio.com/resources/books/}{RStudio books} and Springer
titles for further reading.

\textbf{Collaborate}

An inclusive and collaborative community is an overlooked, yet integral
aspect of a software's success {[}6{]}. A defining feature of R is the
enthusiasm of its users and contributors alike. The R community has a
widespread internet presence across various platforms; however, members
are markedly active on Twitter, a place where R users seek help, share
ideas, and stay informed on \texttt{\#rstats} happenings including
releases of new packages {[}7{]}. Beyond social media, numerous featured
pages and R blogs serve as another informal and up-to-date, yet more
detailed venue for communicating and promoting R-related information
(\textbf{Table ?}). Notably, Joseph Rickert, Ambassador at Large for
RStudio, writes monthly posts on the
\href{https://rviews.rstudio.com/}{R Views} blog highlighting
exceptional new R packages. Rickert also features special articles about
recently released packages and lists of top packages within certain
categories (e.g., Computational Methods, Data, Machine Learning,
Medicine, Science, Statistics, Time Series, Utilities, Visualization).

A developer of an R package may intend for it to be private (exclusively
for personal or professional use) or public (free and available for use
by anyone) {[}8{]}. If your task is specific to a line of research,
consult colleagues to see if they have relevant (private) code they
would be willing to share. Alternatively, literature in your field may
either introduce R packages developed to solve a unique data science
problem or mention packages used during the research process. The former
may be published in the \emph{Journal of Statistical Software},
\emph{The R Journal}, or \emph{BMC Bioinformatics}, for example, and
search queries that include \texttt{"R\ package"} along with domain
keywords will narrow results. The latter requires identifying authors
whom have used R in their analyses, hence useful packages may be
mentioned in the Methods and/or References sections of the article.
Accordingly, formatted citations for R packages can be obtained in R
with \texttt{citation(package\ \ =\ "\ldots{}")}. You can search for
packages directly by name in Google Scholar: the \texttt{Cited\ by} link
displays the number of times a package has been cited and connects to a
page with those publications. Lastly, conferences are another
collaborative environment wherein you can learn about R packages. There
are two major annual R conferences:
\href{https://rstudio.com/conference/}{rstudio::conf} for industry and
useR! for academia. Conferences in your field may foster connections
with fellow scientists whom use R for similar tasks and help you collect
information about packages related to your expertise. Talks and
presentations at conferences are often recorded and made available
online for playback at a later date.

\textbf{Browse}

Based on prior experience---not unlike solution-seeking for many tasks
nowadays---you may think that finding R packages relies heavily on
internet search queries. Indeed, search engines such as Google return
ample pages related to anything \texttt{"\ldots{}in\ R"}. However, this
approach can lead to frustration and confusion when attempting to find a
package tailored to your purpose (see Rule 1). Instead, we recommend
initially searching for packages in repositories such as the
Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN), GitHub, or Bioconductor, all of
which will be further discussed in Rule 3. In particular,
\href{https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/}{CRAN Task Views} are
concentrated topics from certain disciplines and methodologies related
to statistical computing that group R packages by the tasks they perform
(e.g., Econometrics, Genetics, Optimization, Spatial). In the HTML
version, you can browse alphabetized subcategories within each Task View
and read concise descriptions to find tools with specific functions.
Alternatively, you can access Task Views directly from the R console
with \texttt{ctv::CRAN.views()}. To date, there are 41 Task Views that
collectively contain thousands of packages which are curated and
regularly tested. Moreover, CRAN Task Views provide tools that enable
the user to automatically install all packages within a targeted area of
interest. Ultimately, CRAN Task Views address several major user-end
issues that have arisen due to the extensive amount of available
packages by providing task-based organization, easy simultaneous
installation of related packages, meta-information, ensured maintenance,
and quality control {[}9{]}. Relatedly,
\href{http://dirk.eddelbuettel.com/cranberries/index.html}{CRANberries}
is a hub of information about new, updated, and removed packages from
the CRAN network. Another place to find well-maintained tools is through
\href{https://ropensci.org/packages/}{rOpenSci packages}. These R
packages are organized by name, maintainer, description, and status
(i.e., activity, association, review), can be filtered according to
purpose, and searched by name, maintainer, or keywords.

\hypertarget{rule-3-check-how-its-shared}{%
\section{Rule 3: Check how it's
shared}\label{rule-3-check-how-its-shared}}

Packages can be shared through a variety of platforms; a single package
is often available in multiple places. While repositories are the
primary way in which developers share packages for both public and
private use, there are alternatives. Usually in lieu of making packages
accessible to everyone via internet repositories, some developers share
their code in zipped files or directly with collaborators. As far as R
packages are concerned, a repository is essentially a warehouse for
tools before they enter your kitchen; in computing terms, a repository
is analogous to a cloud because it is a central location in which data
is stored and managed. There is growing concern about whether there are
too many R packages and a simultaneous call for quality control
{[}10{]}. Some repositories impose vetting mechanisms that tame unwieldy
aspects of the R ecosystem such as those that regularly check the code
that underlies packages and manage corresponding webs of dependencies.
The traditional repositories for R packages are CRAN, Bioconductor, and
GitHub; however, there are lesser-known remote repositories that have
unique properties.

A plurality of what we know about statistical methods and algorithms is
wrapped up in R packages---written and documented in various ways by R
users. The CRAN package repository is the most established and thereby
main source from which you can install R packages. You can simply use
the \texttt{install.packages} function to install a package from CRAN
which is automatically saved to your computer in a designated package
library. When you would like to use a particular package, you load it to
your R session via the \texttt{library} function from base R. Due to its
longevity and historical role, Rickert asserts that ``CRAN is the
greatest open-source repository for statistical computing knowledge in
the world'' {[}8{]}. Evidently, much of what we know about statistics is
housed in CRAN where people share such information. The R Foundation
manages CRAN and imposes strict regulatory practices for the selection
and maintenance of the packages they host. A package must pass a series
of stability tests in accordance with the CRAN Repository Policy before
obtaining publication privileges {[}11{]}. As such, CRAN only considers
packages that make a substantial contribution to statistical computing
and graphics. CRAN maintainers actively monitor source and contributed
packages to ensure they are compatible with the latest version of R and
modify or remove packages that do not uphold publication quality.

The Bioconductor project was motivated by a need for transparent,
reproducible, and efficient software in computational biology and
bioinformatics to integrate computational rigor and reproducibility with
research on biological processes {[}12{]}. The R environment and its
package system is fundamental to the implementation of Bioconductor's
interoperable and object-oriented (S4) infrastructure. Bioconductor
software is in the form of coordinated, peer reviewed R packages. More
specifically, Bioconductor boasts a modularized design wherein data
structures, functions, and the packages that contain them have distinct
roles that are accompanied by thorough documentation. Accessibility is
pillar of the Bioconductor project, thus all forms of documentation
(e.g., courses, vignettes, interactive documents) are curated for
individuals with expertise in adjacent disciplines and minimal
experience with R (see Rule 4) {[}12{]}. Similar to CRAN, Bioconductor
has strict criteria for package submissions: a package must be relevant
to high-throughput genomic analysis, interoperable with other
Bioconductor packages, well documented, supported in the long-term,
exclusive to Bioconductor, and comply with additional package guidelines
{[}13{]}. Bioconductor packages facilitate the analysis and
comprehension of biological data and help users solve problems that
arise when working with high-throughput genomic data such as those
related to microarrays, sequencing, flow cytometry, mass spectrometry,
and image analysis. As a subset of the R community, Bioconductor has a
supportive and innovative community which hosts annual meetings and
conferences.

The rapid uptick in package development and subsequent inter-repository
dependencies has sparked an ongoing debate as to whether regulated
repositories---including the aforementioned CRAN and Bioconductor---are
preferable to other distribution platforms, namely public version
control systems such as GitHub {[}8,14{]}{[}15{]}. While there are
practical downsides to their restrictive practices, the benefits of
exclusive repositories are evident. Nevertheless, there are considerable
upsides to hosting a package on GitHub {[}8,14{]}. GitHub is a popular
multi-purpose development platform (whereas CRAN and Bioconductor are
not) that is also effective for distributing R packages. An increasing
number of packages are hosted on GitHub during the development stages;
if developers choose not to distribute their package through GitHub, the
stable release versions of such packages are often published on CRAN or
Bioconductor {[}16{]}. GitHub grants R users open-access to package
code, a timeline of help resources (see Rule 4), a direct line of
communication to developers, and permits discovery of up-and-coming
packages (see Rule 2). You can install the latest version of packages
from GitHub via \texttt{devtools::install\_github}; however, the
decentralized nature of GitHub is not conducive to a tool that
automatically locates and installs corresponding dependencies {[}17{]}.
For developers, GitHub provides a convenient means by which anyone can
share and contribute public or private code without barriers to entry.
Authors collaborate within a version-controlled system to develop and
distribute packages including those with dependencies that are not on
CRAN or Bioconductor. Further, the \texttt{drat} package enables
developers to design individual repositories and suites of coordinated
repositories for packages that are stored in and/or distributed through
GitHub {[}18{]}. Both R users and package developers benefit from
interactive feedback channels through GitHub Issues and the Star rating
system.

Most novice R users will rarely encounter packages that are not shared
through the abovementioned platforms. ROpenSci runs a repository that
promotes reusable software and reproducibility when working with
scientific data in research applications {[}19{]}. The repository only
includes packages that have undergone their open review process that is
harmonious with GitHub infrastructure. GitLab is git-based version
control and collaborative cloud for package production and deployment.
It is an alternative to GitHub for production of large-scale packages
that require continuous integration and continuous deployment for
testing data and code to ensure a stable end product. There are
platforms strictly for the development, rather than distribution, of R
packages such as R-Forge and Omegahat, which are beyond our scope
{[}20{]}.

\section{Rule 4: Explore the availability and quality of
help}\label{rule-4-explore-the-availability-and-quality-of-help}}

There has been a call for the development of centralized resources in
statistical computing: those that enable a common understanding of
software quality and reliability (i.e., software information specified
in publications and domain-specific semantic resources) and a single
metadata resource for statistical software {[}10{]}. No such resources
have been consolidated to serve these purposes and given the
decentralized nature of today's information society, it is questionable
whether they will emerge. Current sources of information related to R
packages are dispersed and seemingly boundless in quantity. On one hand,
this allows users to explore diverse solutions and discover new tools;
on the other, not knowing where to find help can lead to inefficient and
ineffectual roundabouts. Clearly, not all package resources share the
same level of quality and the fact that there are many resources in
aggregate, does not imply that every package is associated with the same
availability of resources. While all R packages warrant some minimal
standard of documentation, beginners and users of complex packages merit
more exhaustive information.

You can access information about R packages along with an index of help
pages from the console via \texttt{help(package\ =\ "...")}. Package
information will vary; ideally, packages should have thorough
documentation, but at minimum, every R package should include a
\texttt{DESCRIPTION} file with metadata. The \texttt{DESCRIPTION} is a
succinct record of the package's purpose, dependencies, version, date,
license, associations, authors, and other technical details. The help
pages feature information about the structure of functions within the
package and contain executable examples to demonstrate the relationship
between various inputs and outputs. If the \texttt{DESCRIPTION} and help
pages alone leave you wanting, the package likely does not have further
(quality) documentation and therefore should not be your first choice,
if comparable options exist. In short, if the developer cannot initially
communicate how their tool works, then you may not want to use it in
your kitchen.

Fortunately, plenty of R packages include additional documentation
beyond mere descriptions. The documentation that accompanies functions
within packages is critical; the fact that someone can read the
documentation at a later date and use it in their own work enables
extensibility. RDocumentation is a searchable
\href{https://www.rdocumentation.org/}{website}, package
(\texttt{install.packages("RDocumentation")}), and
\href{https://www.rdocumentation.org/docs/}{JSON API} for obtaining
integrated documentation for packages that are on CRAN, Bioconductor,
and GitHub. This is a subsidiary reason why packages shared on these
platforms tend to be superior (see Rule 3). RDocumentation may include:
an overview, installation instructions, examples of usage, functions,
guides, and vignettes. Most software documentation is rather technical
and extraneous to new users whereas a vignette is a practical type of
documentation in the form of a tutorial. A vignette is a detailed,
long-form document that describes the problems an R package can solve,
then illustrates applications through clear examples of code with
coordination of functions and explanations of outcomes. Packages can
have multiple vignettes; you can view or edit a specific vignette or
obtain a list of all vignettes for a package of interest via the
\texttt{vignette} function.

Some packages are branded quite well and include a comprehensive and
cohesive set resources. Implicitly, this indicates that the authors are
at least serious about their package development, which may lead you to
infer that they know what they (and their package) are doing. Exemplar
documentation that extends far beyond the minimum signifies an
exceptional package. For instance, some packages have websites and/or
books. One popular method that developers use to publish books about
their package is through \texttt{bookdown}, a relatively new extension
of R Markdown that is structured in such a way that integrates code,
text, links, graphics, videos, and other content in a format that can be
published as a free, open, interactive, and downloadable online book
{[}21{]}. As a convenient example, the \texttt{bookdown} package itself
has an \href{https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/}{online book} that
details usage of the package {[}22{]}. For reference, the \texttt{Rccp}
is another package with notable documentation and first-rate help
resources; the developers maintain both a
\href{http://www.rcpp.org/}{main} and
\href{http://dirk.eddelbuettel.com/code/rcpp.html}{additional} website
with a wealth of organized information about the package and resources
including: examples, associations, publications, articles, blogs, code,
books, talks, a mailing list, and links to other resources with
\texttt{Rccp} tags. Aside from the documentation and resources from the
developer, further information about some R packages is sometimes
available in video tutorials, webinars, and code demonstrations (i.e.,
``demos''). Finally, keep in mind that RStudio creates Cheatsheets that
provide concise usage information for popular packages through code and
graphics organized by purpose. Cheatsheets can be accessed directly via
the RStudio Menu (Help \textgreater{} Cheatsheets) or from the
\href{https://rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/}{RStudio website} on
which you can subscribe to Cheatsheet updates and find translated
versions.

Anticipate that you may run into complications beyond the scope of
documentation while using a package. In which case, you will use
resources that involve \emph{asking} for help---should the occasion
arise, you want to be assured that you will find a (satisfactory)
answer. It was formerly the case that the only way to seek assistance
was through the discouraging R-help mailing list; since, the legendary R
community has formed, with inclusion and creative problem solving as
hallmarks of its presence online {[}23{]}. The modern R-help mailing
list to which you can subscribe and send questions is moderated by the R
Core Development Team and includes additional facets for major
announcements about the development of R and availability of new code
(R-announce) and new or enhanced contributed packages (R-packages)
{[}24{]}. Certain packages have independent listservs; \texttt{statnet}
is an example of a suite of packages that has its own
\href{http://statnet.org/}{community listserv}. If a package has a
development repository on GitHub, check the Issues to verify that the
maintainer is responsive to posts and fixes bugs in a timely manner. In
addition, you can search discussion forums such as Stack Overflow, Cross
Validated, and Talk Stats to assess the activity associated with the
package in question. Analyses of the popularity of comparable data
analysis software in email and discussion traffic suggest that R is
rapidly becoming more prevalent and is the leading language by these
metrics {[}25,26{]}. When you encounter a problem, it is good practice
to first update the package to see if the problem is due to a bug in a
previous version---if the problem persists, seek help by finding or
posting a reproducible example {[}27{]}. Overall, avoid using a package
if the collective quality and quantity of resources is lacking.

Alternative solutions can be sought when a package to solve your data
science problem is nonexistent. An R package is the fundamental unit of
shareable code; rather than exclusively being a user of packages, you
can create them---more easily than you may think {[}28{]}. Just as there
are numerous R packages for distinct tasks, the reasons why you might
want to create a package are abundant: necessity, innovation,
standardization, automation, specialty, containment, organization,
sharing, collaboration, extensibility, etc. The essence of an R package
is that it is a self-contained piece of statistical knowledge that can
be used in combination with other self-contained pieces of statistical
knowledge of different shapes and sizes; the uniquely structured
functions within a package help us implement that knowledge and weave it
into novel scientific work.

Whatever your motivation, packages are simply toolkits; you can create a
package out of any collection of specialty functions. Packages need not
be formal nor entirely cohesive. For instance, personal R packages
(e.g., \texttt{Hmisc} and \texttt{broman}) are comprised of
miscellaneous functions which the creator has developed and frequently
uses {[}29,30{]}. Functions are necessary for efficiency and warranted
when you repetitiously copy and paste your code while making slight
modifications after each iteration {[}27{]}. The concept of personal R
packages demonstrates a unique purpose for packages beyond the
conventional. R packages are not solely reserved for specific tasks with
comprehensive methods; rather, package development can help you learn
how to apply proper coding techniques to writing functions and
documentation with reproducibility and collaboration in mind {[}31{]}.

Although you may not anticipate that anyone else will use your tools,
following best practices for package development will yield more
favorable outcomes. As a consumer of shared packages, you know the
inherent benefits of robust software development relative to the quality
of code, data, documentation, versions, and tests {[}32{]}. Similarly,
creating a valuable package for personal use requires consideration for
your future self and anticipation of distributing your code should the
need arise. Consider using version control and take advantage of
existing resources. Indeed, there are R packages that aid in package
development (e.g., \texttt{devtools}, \texttt{usethis},
\texttt{testthat}, \texttt{roxygen2}, \texttt{rlang}, \texttt{drat})
{[}17,33{]}{[}34{]}{[}35{]}{[}36{]}{[}18{]}. In the case of
collaboration, the R project is compatible with distributed
development---a feature that couples well with version control. There is
no lack of effective organizational frameworks to reference in the
open-source R community; in fact, repositories for many exemplary
packages are available on GitHub. We recommend consulting resources
authored by expert R developers including
\href{https://r-pkgs.org/}{\emph{R Packages}} by Hadley Wickham and
Jennifer Bryan as well as the official manual,
\href{https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-exts.html}{\emph{Writing
R Extensions}}, from CRAN {[}28,37{]}.

\hypertarget{conclusion}{%
\section{Conclusion}\label{conclusion}}

Computational reproducibility is surfacing as a central axiom in
academia as researchers identify the need for means by which they can
implement transparent systems {[}38,39{]}. It follows that former
approaches and traditional methods tend to be at odds with productivity
and collaboration; much of the variability in science can be attributed
to differences in workflow such that the absence of automation is deemed
irresponsible {[}40{]}. The open source R language has become the
dominant quantitative programming environment in academic statistics,
enabling researchers to share workflows and reexecute scripts within and
across subsets of the scientific community {[}40{]}. R is increasingly
used by researchers in computational biology and bioinformatics, a
discipline among many that is generating extensive heterogenous and
complex data that demands standard tools and rigorous methods that beget
reproducibility {[}12,41{]}. More broadly, as the R ecosystem---in which
the life of modern data analysis thrives---rapidly evolves alongside the
burgeoning R community, R is exhibiting sustained growth when compared
to similar languages, particularly in academia, healthcare, and
government {[}25{]}.

R packages are a defining feature of the language insofar as many are
robust and easily learnable. Some of the most prominent R packages are a
result of the developer abstracting common elements of a data science
problem into a workflow that can be shared and accompanied by thorough
descriptions of the process and purpose. In this way, R packages have
effectively transformed how we interact with data in the modern day in,
perhaps, a more impactful manner than many revered contributions to
theoretical statistics {[}40{]}. Packages greatly enhance the user
experience and enable you to be more efficient and effective at learning
from data regardless of prior experience. However, the sheer quantity
and potential complexity of available R packages can undermine their
collective benefits. Finding and choosing packages, particularly for
beginners, can be daunting and convoluted. R users often struggle to
sift through the tools at their disposal and wonder how to distinguish
appropriate usage. These ten simple rules for navigating the shared code
in the R community are intended to serve as a valuable page in your
computing cookbook---one that will evolve into intuition yet remain a
reliable reference. May searching for and selecting proper tools no
longer spoil your appetite and dissuade you from discovering, trying,
creating, and sharing new recipes.
