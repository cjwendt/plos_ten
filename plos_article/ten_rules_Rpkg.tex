\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}}

R is a language and environment for statistical computing and graphics
that was developed by statisticians and is collaboratively maintained by
an international core group of contributors. Unlike many popular
proprietary languages (e.g., MATLAB, SAS, SPSS), R is highly extensible,
free and open-source software; the user can access and thus change,
extend, and share code for desired applications. Accordingly, a vibrant
community of R users has emerged, many of which engage in the
development of extensions to the functionality of base R software known
as packages. There are many analogies in computing that draw comparisons
between programming and culinary arts: recipe structures, coding
cookbooks, and the like. To conceptualize packages, imagine you are the
chef, R is the kitchen, and packages are the special gadgets which allow
you to cook and bake new recipes. R packages are coding delectables that
enable the user to perform practical tasks and solve problems with
interesting techniques.

Are there R packages for wrangling and cleaning data frames, designing
interactive apps for data visualization, or performing dimensionality
reduction? Yes! How do you find an R package that will help you train
regression and classification models, assess the beta diversity of a
population, or analyze gene expression microarray data? The answer is
not as simple; there are tens of thousands of R packages. As a natural
consequence of the open-source nature of R, there is variation in the
quality of different packages among the numerous choices that exist. The
advanced R user---having developed an intuition for their workflow---may
tend to be relatively confident when searching for and selecting
packages. By contrast, a common experience that characterizes learning R
at the outset is the struggle to 1) find a package to accomplish a
particular task or solve a problem of interest and 2) choose the best
package to perform that task. Even so, there remain obscure and
complicated problems that morph selecting an R package into a barrier
despite experience.

In coding as in life, we endeavor to make choices that optimize
outcomes. Just as one may go about shopping for shoes, deciding which
graduate program to pursue, or conducting a literature review, there is
a science behind selection. We inform our decisions by assessing,
comparing, and filtering options based on indicators of quality such as
utility, association, and reputation. Likewise, choosing an R package
requires attending to similar details. We outline ten simple rules for
finding and selecting R packages so that you will spend less time
searching for the right tools and more time coding delicious recipes.

\hypertarget{rule-1-consider-your-purpose}{%
\section{Rule 1: Consider your
purpose}\label{rule-1-consider-your-purpose}}

There are often several different ways to accomplish a task or arrive at
a solution while programming, albeit some ways are more elegant and
efficient than others. While there are certainly ways to cook up an
algorithm using for loops and conditionals in base R, a relevant package
may accomplish the same goal in a more reproducible manner with less
code and fewer bugs. If you define your purpose by making observations
about and considering limitations of your current toolbox before you
start searching for new tools, you will be more likely to recognize what
you do (and don't) need.

Think about what you are doing (or trying to do) and how you might like
to do it. Identify the type of inputs you have and envision working with
them; contemplate the desired outputs and corresponding format. Which
existing functionalities in base R could be improved in context of your
problem? Which new functionalities would you like to add to base R to
expand what you can do? You may have a unique or particular task that
requires highly specialized functions. Some R packages are simple and
have a very specific use. For example, there is a package for converting
English letters to numbers as on a telephone keypad {[}2{]}. On the
other hand, you may be faced with an extensive task that justifies a
broader framework with several functions that form a cohesive package.
Numerous processes that involve data---although varying in
application---are ubiquitous. Data manipulation is one such common task
that has been streamlined by packages such as \texttt{dplyr} and
\texttt{data.table} {[}3,4{]}.

In general, the more reasonable it is for your given task to be
abstracted away from its context, the more plausible it is that someone
has generalized its themes, bundled them up, and branded them in a nice
way---often \emph{much} nicer than expected. Nevertheless, there are
indeed packages for seemingly singular tasks, which you may be
pleasantly surprised to discover. You need not invent the wheel before
checking to see if it already exists, but before you sift through
options, having some notion of what you need will narrow your search.

\hypertarget{rule-2-spend-time-searching-find-and-collect-options}{%
\section{Rule 2: Spend time searching; find and collect
options}\label{rule-2-spend-time-searching-find-and-collect-options}}

There are three main categories that distinguish various methods for
finding R packages: learning, collaboration, and searching. Firstly,
packages are essential to venturing beyond base R and thus quickly
become an integral aspect of advancing your R skills. In other words,
when learning R, you are typically introduced to some of the most
commonly used packages. This does not, however, imply that such packages
are necessarily the most basic. Online tutorials, courses, and textbooks
tend to be reliable resources for acquiring knowledge about packages
that are particularly versatile and reliable. We recommend ------------
for interactive learning and --------- textbooks (``{[}x{]} with R''
series) such as the \href{https://rstudio.com/resources/books/}{RStudio
books} for further reading.

\section{Conclusion}\label{conclusion}}

Computational reproducibility is surfacing as a central axiom in
academia as researchers identify the need for means by which they can
implement transparent systems. As a corollary, former approaches are
often found to be at odds with productivity and collaboration. The R
programming language is increasingly used by researchers in
computational biology and bioinformatics, a discipline among many that
is generating extensive heterogenous and complex data that demands
sophisticated tools and rigorous methods {[}5,6{]}.

R packages are a defining feature of the language insofar as many are
robust and easily learnable. Packages greatly enhance the user
experience and enable you to be more efficient and effective at learning
from data regardless of prior experience. However, the sheer quantity
and potential complexity of available R packages can undermine their
collective benefits. Finding and choosing packages, particularly for
beginners, can be daunting and convoluted. R users often struggle to
sift through the tools at their disposal and wonder how to distinguish
appropriate usage. These ten simple rules for navigating the shared code
in the R community are intended to serve as a valuable page in your
computing cookbook---one that will evolve into intuition yet remain a
reliable reference. May searching for and selecting proper tools no
longer spoil your appetite and dissuade you from discovering, trying,
creating, and sharing new recipes.
