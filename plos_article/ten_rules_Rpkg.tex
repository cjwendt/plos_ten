\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}}

R is a language and environment for statistical computing and graphics
that was developed by statisticians and is collaboratively maintained by
an international core group of contributors {[}2{]}. Unlike several
popular proprietary languages (e.g., MATLAB, SAS, SPSS), R is highly
extensible, free and open-source software; the user can access and thus
change, extend, and share code for desired applications. Accordingly, a
vibrant community of R users has emerged, many of which engage in the
development of extensions to the functionality of base R software known
as packages. There are plenty of analogies in computing that draw
comparisons between programming and culinary arts: recipe structures,
coding cookbooks, and the like. To conceptualize packages, imagine you
are the chef, R is the kitchen, and packages are the special gadgets
which allow you to cook and bake new recipes. R packages are coding
delectables that enable the user to perform practical tasks and solve
problems with interesting techniques.

Are there R packages for wrangling and cleaning data frames, designing
interactive apps for data visualization, or performing dimensionality
reduction? Yes! How do you find an R package that will help you train
regression and classification models, assess the beta diversity of a
population, or analyze gene expression microarray data? The answer is
not as simple; there are tens of thousands of R packages. As a natural
consequence of the open-source nature of R, there is variation in the
quality of different packages among the numerous choices that exist. The
advanced R user---having developed an intuition for their workflow---may
tend to be relatively confident when searching for and selecting
packages. By contrast, a common experience that characterizes learning R
at the outset is the struggle to 1) find a package to accomplish a
particular task or solve a problem of interest and 2) choose the best
package to perform that task. Even so, there remain obscure and
complicated problems that morph selecting an R package into a barrier
despite experience.

In coding as in life, we endeavor to make choices that optimize
outcomes. Just as one may go about shopping for shoes, deciding which
graduate program to pursue, or conducting a literature review, there is
a science behind selection. We inform our decisions by assessing,
comparing, and filtering options based on indicators of quality such as
utility, association, and reputation. Likewise, choosing an R package
requires attending to similar details. We outline ten simple rules for
finding and selecting R packages so that you will spend less time
searching for the right tools and more time coding delicious recipes.

\hypertarget{rule-1-consider-your-purpose}{%
\section{Rule 1: Consider your
purpose}\label{rule-1-consider-your-purpose}}

There are often several different ways to accomplish a task or arrive at
a solution while programming, albeit some ways are more elegant and
efficient than others. To optimize your workflow, consider your purpose
by 1) identifying your task to understand what you are trying to do and
2) defining the scope of the task to determine how you are going to do
it. For some tasks, coding your own recipe with existing tools is
practical, while other tasks benefit from new tools.

If the scope of your task is simple or reasonable given your knowledge
and skills, using an R package may not be appropriate. That is, some
instances do not warrant additional functions, data, and documentation.
There are advantages of coding in base R to implement a unique solution
for your problem. In particular, when you code from scratch, you know
precisely what you are running; thus, your script may be easier to
decipher and maintain. Conversely, packages require reliance on shared
code with features of which you may not be aware.

Packages are valuable when a task has a broad scope or is beyond the
scope of what you desire to code in base R; a task that is narrow in
scope is not necessarily simple. While there are ways to cook up an
algorithm using for loops and conditionals in base R, a relevant package
may accomplish the same goal in a more reproducible manner with less
code and fewer bugs. In general, the more reasonable it is for a given
task to be abstracted away from its context, the more plausible it is
that someone has generalized its themes, developed efficient algorithms,
and organized them in an intuitive way to share with other R users.
Extensive tasks justify sophisticated frameworks with several functions
that form a cohesive package. Numerous processes that involve
data---although varying in application---are ubiquitous. Data
manipulation is one such common task that has been streamlined by
packages such as \texttt{dplyr} and \texttt{tidyr} {[}3,4{]} (See Table
1). Nevertheless, there are indeed packages for seemingly singular
tasks, which you may favor over coding from scratch. Some R packages are
small and have a specific use conducive to tasks that require highly
specialized functions. For example, there is a package for converting
English letters to numbers as on a telephone keypad {[}5{]}.

If you define your purpose by making observations about and considering
limitations of your current toolbox before you start searching for new
tools, you will be more likely to recognize what you do (and do not)
need. Which existing functionalities in base R could be improved in
context of your problem? Which new functionalities would you like to add
to base R to expand what you can do? Develop a list of domain-specific
keywords that relate what you are trying to do to how one may go about
doing it to narrow your search. Identify the type of inputs you have and
envision working with them; contemplate the desired outputs and
corresponding format. For instance, suppose you are using Bioconductor
packages in analyses and have data you would like to visualize; you must
consider that the inputs will be of a certain class---namely, S3 or S4
objects---that impose restrictions when creating graphics. The data
visualization package you use should address such limitations.

\hypertarget{rule-2-spend-time-searching-find-and-collect-options}{%
\section{Rule 2: Spend time searching; find and collect
options}\label{rule-2-spend-time-searching-find-and-collect-options}}

Those who have used R packages may know that although leveraging
existing tools can be advantageous, the initial challenge of finding a
suitable package for a given task can obstruct potential benefits.
Relatedly, new R users who are unfamiliar with the structure and syntax
of the language may be hindered by the process of finding R packages
because they do not know where to search, what to look for, nor how to
sift through options. R packages are mentioned in a variety of places
online, in print, and elsewhere. You can discover new R packages anytime
you learn R-related topics, collaborate with other R users, or browse
the internet.

\textbf{Learn}

Packages are essential to venturing beyond base R and thus quickly
become an integral aspect of advancing your R skills. When learning how
to program in R, you are typically introduced to some of the most common
packages, which tend to have more general purposes (\textbf{Table 1}).
In addition, reputable online tutorials, courses, and books are helpful
resources for acquiring knowledge about packages that are versatile and
reliable---many of which are short, accessible, and either affordable or
offered at no cost to the learner. We recommend online R programming
courses such as those through
\href{https://www.coursera.org/learn/r-programming}{Coursera} and
\href{https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-r}{Codeacademy} for
interactive learning and R book series including the
\href{https://rstudio.com/resources/books/}{RStudio books} and Springer
titles for further reading.

\textbf{Collaborate}

An inclusive and collaborative community is an overlooked, yet integral
aspect of a software's success {[}6{]}. A defining feature of R is the
enthusiasm of its users and contributors alike. The R community has a
widespread internet presence across various platforms; however, members
are markedly active on Twitter, a place where R users seek help, share
ideas, and stay informed on \texttt{\#rstats} happenings including
releases of new packages {[}7{]}. Beyond social media, numerous featured
pages and R blogs serve as another informal and up-to-date, yet more
detailed venue for communicating and promoting R-related information
(\textbf{Table ?}). Notably, Joseph Rickert, Ambassador at Large for
RStudio, writes monthly posts on the
\href{https://rviews.rstudio.com/}{R Views} blog highlighting
exceptional new R packages in addition to special articles about
recently released packages and lists of top packages within certain
categories (e.g., Computational Methods, Data, Machine Learning,
Medicine, Science, Statistics, Time Series, Utilities, Visualization).

A developer of an R package may intend for it to be private (exclusively
for personal or professional use) or public (free and available for use
by anyone) {[}8{]}. If your task is specific to a line of research,
consult colleagues to see if they have relevant (private) code they
would be willing to share. Alternatively, literature in your field may
either introduce R packages developed to solve a unique data science
problem or mention packages used during the research process. The former
may be published in the \emph{Journal of Statistical Software},
\emph{The R Journal}, or \emph{BMC Bioinformatics}, for example, and
search queries that include \texttt{"R\ package"} along with domain
keywords will narrow results. The latter requires identifying authors
whom have used R in their analyses, hence packages may be mentioned in
the Methods and/or References sections of the article. Accordingly,
formatted citations for R packages can be obtained in R with
\texttt{citation(package\ \ =\ "\ldots{}")}. You can search for packages
directly by name in Google Scholar: the \texttt{Cited\ by} link displays
the number of times a package has been cited which connects to a page
with those publications. Lastly, conferences are another collaborative
environment wherein you can learn about R packages. There are two major
annual R conferences,
\href{https://rstudio.com/conference/}{rstudio::conf} for industry and
useR! for academia; conferences in your field may foster connections
with fellow scientists whom use R for similar tasks and help you collect
information about packages related to your expertise. Talks and
presentations at conferences are often recorded and made available
online for playback at a later date.

\textbf{Browse}

Based on prior experience---not unlike solution-seeking for many tasks
nowadays---you may think that finding R packages relies heavily on
internet search queries. Indeed, search engines such as Google return
ample pages related to anything \texttt{"\ldots{}in\ R"}. However, this
approach can lead to frustration and confusion when attempting to find a
package for your purpose (see Rule 1). Instead, we recommend initially
searching for packages in repositories such as the Comprehensive R
Archive Network (CRAN), GitHub, or Bioconductor, all of which will be
further discussed in Rule 3. In particular,
\href{https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/}{CRAN Task Views} are
concentrated topics from certain disciplines and methodologies related
to statistical computing that group R packages by the tasks they perform
(e.g., Econometrics, Genetics, Optimization, Spatial). In the HTML
version, you can browse alphabetized subcategories within each Task View
and read concise descriptions to find tools with specific functions.
Alternatively, you can access Task Views directly from the R console
with \texttt{ctv::CRAN.views()}. To date, there are 41 Task Views that
collectively contain thousands of packages which are curated and
regularly tested. Moreover, CRAN Task Views provide tools that enable
the user to automatically install all packages within a targeted area of
interest. Ultimately, CRAN Task Views address several major user-end
issues that have arisen due to the extensive amount of available
packages by providing task-based organization, easy simultaneous
installation of related packages, meta-information, ensured maintenance,
and quality control {[}9{]}. Another place to find well-maintained tools
that promote reusable software and reproducibility when working with
scientific data in research applications is through
\href{https://ropensci.org/packages/}{rOpenSci packages}. Packages are
organized by name, maintainer, description, and status (i.e., activity,
association, review), can be filtered according to purpose, and searched
by name, maintainer, or keywords.

\section{Rule 10: Develop your own
package}\label{rule-10-develop-your-own-package}}

Alternative solutions can be sought when a package to solve your data
science problem is nonexistent. An R package is the fundamental unit of
shareable code; rather than exclusively being a user of packages, you
can create them---more easily than you may think {[}10{]}. Just as there
are numerous R packages for distinct tasks, the reasons why you might
want to create a package are abundant: necessity, innovation,
standardization, automation, specialty, containment, organization,
sharing, collaboration, extensibility, etc.

Whatever your motivation, R packages are simply toolkits; you can create
a package out of any collection of specialty functions. Packages need
not be formal nor entirely cohesive. For instance, personal R packages
(e.g., \texttt{Hmisc} and \texttt{broman}) are comprised of
miscellaneous functions which the creator has developed and frequently
uses {[}11,12{]}. Functions are necessary for efficiency and warranted
when you repetitiously copy and paste your code while making slight
modifications after each iteration {[}13{]}. The concept of personal R
packages demonstrates a unique purpose for packages beyond the
conventional. R packages are not solely reserved for specific tasks with
comprehensive methods; rather, package development can help you learn
how to apply proper coding techniques to writing functions and
documentation with reproducibility and collaboration in mind {[}14{]}.

Although you may not anticipate that anyone else will use your tools,
following best practices for package development will yield more
favorable outcomes. As a consumer of shared packages, you know the
inherent benefits of robust software development relative to the quality
of code, data, documentation, versions, and tests {[}15{]}. Similarly,
creating a valuable package for personal use requires consideration for
your future self and anticipation of distributing your code should the
need arise. Consider using version control and take advantage of
existing resources. Indeed, there are R packages that aid in package
development (e.g., \texttt{devtools}, \texttt{usethis},
\texttt{testthat}, \texttt{roxygen2}, \texttt{rlang}, \texttt{drat}).
There is no lack of effective organizational frameworks to reference in
the open source R community; in fact, repositories for many exemplary
packages are available on GitHub. We recommend consulting resources
authored by expert R developers including \href{https://r-pkgs.org/}{R
Packages} by Hadley Wickham and Jennifer Bryan as well as the official
manual,
\href{https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-exts.html}{Writing
R Extensions}, from CRAN {[}10,16{]}.

\hypertarget{conclusion}{%
\section{Conclusion}\label{conclusion}}

Computational reproducibility is surfacing as a central axiom in
academia as researchers identify the need for means by which they can
implement transparent systems {[}17,18{]}. It follows that former
approaches and traditional methods tend to be at odds with productivity
and collaboration; much of the variability in science can be attributed
to differences in workflow such that the absence of automation is deemed
irresponsible {[}19{]}. The open source R language has become the
dominant quantitative programming environment in academic statistics,
enabling researchers to share workflows and reexecute scripts within and
across subsets of the scientific community {[}19{]}. R is increasingly
used by researchers in computational biology and bioinformatics, a
discipline among many that is generating extensive heterogenous and
complex data that demands standard tools and rigorous methods that beget
reproducibility {[}20,21{]}. More broadly, as the R ecosystem---in which
the life of modern data analysis thrives---rapidly evolves alongside the
burgeoning R community, R is exhibiting sustained growth when compared
to similar languages, particularly in academia, healthcare, and
government {[}22{]}.

R packages are a defining feature of the language insofar as many are
robust and easily learnable. Some of the most prominent R packages are a
result of the developer abstracting common elements of a data science
problem into a workflow that can be shared and accompanied by thorough
descriptions of the process and purpose. In this way, R packages have
effectively transformed how we interact with data in the modern day in,
perhaps, a more impactful manner than many revered contributions to
theoretical statistics {[}19{]}. Packages greatly enhance the user
experience and enable you to be more efficient and effective at learning
from data regardless of prior experience. However, the sheer quantity
and potential complexity of available R packages can undermine their
collective benefits. Finding and choosing packages, particularly for
beginners, can be daunting and convoluted. R users often struggle to
sift through the tools at their disposal and wonder how to distinguish
appropriate usage. These ten simple rules for navigating the shared code
in the R community are intended to serve as a valuable page in your
computing cookbook---one that will evolve into intuition yet remain a
reliable reference. May searching for and selecting proper tools no
longer spoil your appetite and dissuade you from discovering, trying,
creating, and sharing new recipes.
