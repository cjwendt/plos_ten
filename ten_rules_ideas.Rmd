# Brainstorm

- CRAN
- documentation, help files, cheatsheets
- verify the authors' credibility and associations
- publications introducing package (e.g., *The R Journal*)
- percentile on CRAN
- compare number of downloads
- dates and versions; log of updates; latest version; bug fixes; "orphaned" package
- check source code to see if authors follow best practices for package development
- purpose; compare features across multiple packages that accomplish similar tasks
- dependency checks (strength of other packages it relies upon)
- unit tests (for each function to see it is working as expected) and full-coverage within unit tests
