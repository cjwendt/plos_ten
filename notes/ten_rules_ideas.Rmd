# Brainstorm
- CRAN
- documentation, help files, cheatsheets
- verify the authors' credibility and associations
- publications introducing package (e.g., *The R Journal*)
- percentile on CRAN
- compare number of downloads
- dates and versions; log of updates; latest version; bug fixes; "orphaned" package
- check source code to see if authors follow best practices for package development
- purpose; compare features across multiple packages that accomplish similar tasks
- dependency checks (strength of other packages it relies upon)
- unit tests (for each function to see it is working as expected) and full-coverage within unit tests

# Two stages of package selection
1.	**Exploration:** How do you find a package?
- Internet searches (â€¦in R)
- Conferences
- Social media (#rstats)
- Textbooks
- CRAN task views

2.	**Selection:** Once you found some options for packages to accomplish a task, how do you know which one is best to use?

- Features
- Repositories
- Documentation
- Authors
- Unit testing
- Peer review
- Established
- Explore code
- Indicators of package quality: reputation, association, resources and documentation, development, purpose and uses

# Visualizations, tables, figures
- Table of repositories
- Top R packages by number of downloads (see Leaderboard in RDocumentation)
- Top R packages by percentile
- Types of documentation
- Roadmap

# Audience
- Particular interest in R with applications in computational biology

# Questions
- Is there an issue with indentation of the first paragraph of the introduction?
- Do we want to have a more conversational voice or style in the writing?
  - Language in intro (you, we, one, or the user)?
- Should we add more audience-specific language (tasks, problems, decisions)?
